# Class 6 Part 1: Regression
## Math
If we list all the whole positive numbers below 10 that are mutiples of 3 or 5, we get 3,5,6,9. The sum of these mutiples is 23. 
Find the sum of all the mutiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
```
10 %% 3 
```
+ %% gets us the remainder. 
+ If a value is the multiple of 3 or 5, then 10 %% 3 == 0 OR 10 %% 5 == 0.
```
x = 1: 999
out = c()
for()
```
